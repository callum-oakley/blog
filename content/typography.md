Despite working almost exclusively on backend software, I'm pretty enthusiastic about design, and especially about typography. This blog is as much an opportunity for me to play with fonts and typography as it is to do some writing. With that in mind I wanted to mention the fonts I was using -- for anyone else who's in to that:

- The text face is Bold Monday's [Quinn Text][], designed by Diana Ovezea.
- The headings and code are set in [IBM Plex][], also from Bold Monday.

If you think this site looks nice, or if I've made some huge typographic faux pas: please let me know! I'd love to get better. Also, if you share my enthusiasm for typography, I have two book recommendations, both of which I enjoyed immensely:

- Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography][] (I wish the whole internet looked like this)
- Robert Bringhurst's *The Elements of Typographic Style* (probably the most beautiful book in the world)
